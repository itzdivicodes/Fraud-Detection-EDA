*Fraud Detection in Bank Transactions - EDA & Machine Learning*

Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in banking datasets using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) models. We analyze transaction data, preprocess it, and use multiple ML models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Project Workflow
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-- Univariate Analysis
-- Multivariate Analysi
Predictive, Descriptive, Diagnostic, and Prescriptive Analysis
Feature Selection & Feature Extraction

Machine Learning Models Used
XGBoost Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Isolation Forest (for anomaly detection)
Hybrid Model

Model Evaluation & Ensembling
Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Use ensemble techniques (bagging, boosting, stacking) to determine the best approach.
Identify which model performs best under different ensembling strategies.

Conclusion
This project applies EDA and ML to effectively detect fraudulent bank transactions. By using multiple models and ensembling techniques, we enhance detection accuracy and reliability.
