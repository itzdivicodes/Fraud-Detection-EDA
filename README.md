# Fraudulent Transaction Detection in Banking

## Project Overview
Fraudulent transactions pose a significant risk to the banking sector, leading to financial losses and security breaches. This project leverages data-driven techniques and machine learning models to enhance fraud detection capabilities, improving security and minimizing potential risks.

## Project Workflow
1. **Dataset Acquisition & Loading**
   - Collected and loaded banking transaction data into the workspace.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values.
   - Encoded categorical features and scaled numerical data for consistency.

3. **Data Visualization & Analysis**
   - Explored transaction trends and identified anomalies using visualization techniques.

4. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Implemented individual models: Isolation Forest, XGBoost, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Random Forest Classifier.
   - Developed a hybrid model that integrates multiple algorithms to optimize fraud detection performance.

5. **Results & Insights**
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualized key findings to understand model effectiveness.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost  
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab  

## Conclusion
By combining machine learning techniques with data visualization, this project enhances fraud detection capabilities in the banking sector. The hybrid model demonstrates strong potential for real-world application, improving security and reducing financial risks associated with fraudulent transactions.
