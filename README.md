**Fraud Detection in Bank Transactions - EDA & Machine Learning**

***Project Overview***\n
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in banking datasets using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) models. We analyze transaction data, preprocess it, and use multiple ML models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

***Project Workflow***\n
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n
-- Univariate Analysis\n
-- Multivariate Analysis\n
Predictive, Descriptive, Diagnostic, and Prescriptive Analysis\n
Feature Selection & Feature Extraction\n

***Machine Learning Models Used***\n
XGBoost Classifier\n
Random Forest Classifier\n
Logistic Regression\n
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\n
Isolation Forest (for anomaly detection)\n
Hybrid Model\n

***Model Evaluation & Ensembling***\n
Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n
Use ensemble techniques (bagging, boosting, stacking) to determine the best approach.\n
Identify which model performs best under different ensembling strategies.\n

***Conclusion***\n
This project applies EDA and ML to effectively detect fraudulent bank transactions. By using multiple models and ensembling techniques, we enhance detection accuracy and reliability.\n
